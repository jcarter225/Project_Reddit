# Project_Reddit
This repository contains files for a word cloud project aggregating data from political subreddits. The purpose of this project was to determine which subjects were most salient to conservatives, liberals, and politically neutral individuals.

To this end, 1000 'hot' posts were collected from 3 subreddits, each focusing on the aforementioned political groups. Words for each post were extracted and cleaned to assess word frequency. Finally, word clouds were created for each political group via Tableau. 

Note about Python script:
The Python script listed in this repository works with slight modifications to the code (supplying one's own Reddit credentials on lines 28-30 and uncommenting lines 96-98 to save the data frames from which the word clouds are formed). As is typical, the requirements to run this script can be found in requirements.txt.
